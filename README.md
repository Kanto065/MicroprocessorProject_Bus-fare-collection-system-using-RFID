# MicroprocessorProject_Bus-fare-collection-system-using-RFID

In accordance with the distance traveled, our project attempted to automatically identify the passenger and deduct the appropriate fare. The usage of the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) card allows for extremely accurate passenger and transaction identification. The usage of RFID cards is more practical, user-friendly, and reusable than the paper-based ticketing system. There will be a public distribution of RFID cards. Each person with an RFID card will receive a unique ID after the personnel information is gathered.
